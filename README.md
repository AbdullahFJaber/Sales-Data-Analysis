# Sales-Data-Analysis
This project transforms raw sales data from Excel into actionable insights using Power BI. It includes interactive dashboards showing overall sales, top products, category performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. Explore KPIs, charts, and maps to support clear and data-driven decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is based on open-source data for educational purposes. It represents a complete sales analysis for company X. The analysis was initially started using Excel, but due to severe performance issuesâ€”such as frequent crashes, extreme slowness, and the inability to build and save interactive dashboardsâ€”the approach was shifted to Power BI.

While only static screenshots could be taken from Excel, the full project was successfully rebuilt in Power BI, enabling interactive dashboards, smooth analysis, and a better user experience.

## âš¡ Challenges & Solutions

- Challenge 1: Excel dashboard became very heavy and crashed frequently.

 Solution: Rebuilt the entire project in Power BI, which handled large datasets efficiently.

- Challenge 2: Excel did not support fully interactive dashboards.

Solution: Used Power BI to create interactive visuals, slicers, and dynamic KPIs.

- Challenge 3: Saving and sharing dashboards from Excel was not possible.

Solution: Published the Power BI report online with interactive access through a shareable link.

- Challenge 4: The provided Excel file works smoothly for raw data exploration, but completing the full dashboard in Excel was not possible due to performance limitations.

Solution: The Excel file is included for reference and comparison with the final Power BI solution.
