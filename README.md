# Sales-Data-Analysis
This project transforms raw sales data from Excel into actionable insights using Power BI. It includes interactive dashboards showing overall sales, top products, category performance, customer behavior, and regional trends. Explore KPIs, charts, and maps to support clear and data-driven decision-making.

## üìå Overview

This project is based on open-source data for educational purposes. It represents a complete sales analysis for company X. The analysis was initially started using Excel, but due to severe performance issues‚Äîsuch as frequent crashes, extreme slowness, and the inability to build and save interactive dashboards‚Äîthe approach was shifted to Power BI.

While only static screenshots could be taken from Excel, the full project was successfully rebuilt in Power BI, enabling interactive dashboards, smooth analysis, and a better user experience.

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions

- Challenge 1: Excel dashboard became very heavy and crashed frequently.

 Solution: Rebuilt the entire project in Power BI, which handled large datasets efficiently.

- Challenge 2: Excel did not support fully interactive dashboards.

Solution: Used Power BI to create interactive visuals, slicers, and dynamic KPIs.

- Challenge 3: Saving and sharing dashboards from Excel was not possible.

Solution: Published the Power BI report online with interactive access through a shareable link.

- Challenge 4: The provided Excel file works smoothly for raw data exploration, but completing the full dashboard in Excel was not possible due to performance limitations.

Solution: The Excel file is included for reference and comparison with the final Power BI solution.

##üéØ Project Objectives

1- Analyze total sales performance and identify overall business trends.

2- Highlight top-performing products and categories to understand demand patterns.

3- Compare sales across branches and regions to evaluate geographical performance.

4- Assess brand contributions to total revenue through percentage and tree map visuals.

5- Understand payment method distribution and customer preferences.

6- Provide key performance indicators (KPIs) for decision-making (total sales, number of customers, number of orders, active countries).

7- Deliver interactive dashboards that allow dynamic filtering by branch, brand, category, and time period.

##üåç Note on Country Count

The dataset contains 229 unique country entries, which is higher than the actual number of countries worldwide (~195).
This discrepancy is due to the inclusion of:

Overseas territories (e.g., Guadeloupe, Bermuda, Greenland).

Regions with special administrative status (e.g., Hong Kong, Macao).

Disputed/limited-recognition areas (e.g., Western Sahara).

This reflects the dataset‚Äôs structure rather than a data error, and it provides additional geographical granularity for business analysis.
